When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to share my commits to other.
And when I want to save it online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that I can First check my commit online. and decide weather I want to pull it or not. Rather than Git automatically staying upto date with my repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is used when clonning from one user to ourself in github.
clones is used to clone commit and files from one computer or giver URL
braches are used when committing different versions which is optional. Or to create a bug fixing commit while Main commit will be running for Users.
